Please update the current implementation of the Waiver Acknowledgment page to resolve layout issues, fix signature behavior, and improve the design and interaction patterns. Follow these detailed corrections:

📌 1. Remove Initials Tag from Paragraph 1
The first paragraph of the waiver is an introduction and should not have an initials field.

Only the remaining 5 paragraphs should include a yellow “Initial Here” tag.

📌 2. Fix Initial Tag Overlap with Paragraph Text
Do not let text flow behind or under the yellow initials tag.

Instead, implement a two-column layout inside each paragraph block:

Left Column: 85% width for the waiver text

Right Column: 15% width reserved for the initials box (aligned vertically to the center of its clause)

This avoids overlapping and preserves line wrapping.

📌 3. Align Yes/No Options to the Right of Each Question
Display each safety screening question on a single horizontal row:

Left: Full question text

Right: “Yes” and “No” pill-style toggle buttons

This layout should mirror the appearance of mobile forms or legal checklists with in-line responses.

📌 4. Default Safety Questions to “No” Selected
When the page loads, all three Yes/No questions should have “No” preselected.

The user can still change to “Yes,” but “No” is assumed unless changed.

📌 5. Fix Signature/Initials Modal Behavior
When the user clicks any yellow field (signature or initials):

Open a single modal for both signature and initials

After the user inputs both:

Do not auto-apply to every field

Only apply to the field that was clicked

The remaining fields (initials or signature) must still be manually clicked to confirm and apply the saved version

Once saved, do not open the modal again unless the user clicks “Edit Signature” or “Edit Initials”

Update the modal’s CTA button to: Save and Continue

📌 6. Default to Type View in Signature Modal
When the signature modal opens, default to the “Type” tab rather than the Draw tab.

Still allow users to toggle to Draw if preferred.

📌 7. Fix Initials Preview Logic
When user types their name in the “Type Signature” box, the initials should:

Auto-generate from the first letters of the typed name

Example: “Eric Rabinovitz” → “ER”

Display this stylized in the initials preview box next to the signature.
