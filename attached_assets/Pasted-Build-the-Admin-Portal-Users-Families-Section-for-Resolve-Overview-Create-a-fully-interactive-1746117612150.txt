Build the Admin Portal – “Users & Families” Section for Resolve
Overview:
Create a fully interactive prototype of the Users & Families section of the Resolve Admin Portal. This is an internal-only admin tool that allows our team to manage families using the Resolve platform, view their Parenting Plan progress, course scheduling details, engagement, and system flags.

This is Phase 1 of the Admin Portal. It must be clean, fast, and logically structured — and ready to evolve into a production-grade tool after prototyping.

🧱 Overall Page Layout
Split the screen into two main parts:

LEFT COLUMN (25–30% width): Family List
Search bar (top)

Filter dropdowns:

Plan Status: All / Not Started / In Progress / Complete

Co-Parent Joined: All / Yes / No

Course Scheduled: All / Yes / No

Scrollable list of families (repeating group or table)

Each list item should include:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Family Name (or Family ID)
Parents: Eric & Sarah
Children: Mila (9), Jonah (6)
Plan: In Progress
Last Active: 2 days ago
Flags: 1
Clicking a family loads their detail view in the right column.

RIGHT PANEL (70–75% width): Family Profile View
Tabbed interface or clear vertical sections with the following content:

1️⃣ Overview
Parenting Plan Status (% complete or "Not Started")

Waiver Status: ✅ / ❌

Holiday Preferences: ✅ / ❌

Co-Parent Status: Joined / Invited / Not Invited

Last Activity Date

Buttons:

[View Plan PDF]

[Mark as Flagged] / [Clear Flags]

2️⃣ Course Scheduling
Has course been scheduled? (Yes / No)

Proposed Date & Time

Confirmed by both parents? (Yes / No)

Buttons:

[Resend Invite]

[Update Schedule]

3️⃣ Parenting Plan Sections
Show section-by-section status:

Custody: ✅

Communication: ✅

Holidays: ❌

Travel: ✅

Finalized: No

Use a clean checklist or progress blocks.

Optional: Add “Last edited” timestamps for each section

4️⃣ Engagement Log
Timeline or list format:

css
Copy
Edit
[✔] Eric invited Sarah – Apr 12  
[✔] Sarah accepted invite – Apr 14  
[✔] Waivers signed – Apr 15  
[⏳] Holiday prefs incomplete  
[✔] Started Plan – Apr 15  
[⏳] Course not yet scheduled
5️⃣ Flags & Intervention
Show active system-generated alerts:

❗ Co-Parent not joined after 7 days

❗ Waivers incomplete

❗ Course not scheduled

Admin notes (add/edit/delete)

Status: Active / Resolved

Button: [Send Reminder Email]

🧪 For the Prototype in Replit
Use mock data for 3–5 families

Simulate different states (plan complete, no course scheduled, flags triggered)

No backend yet, but simulate interactivity (i.e., filters change list, flag toggles update state)

Allow expanding/collapsing family detail panel for smooth navigation

🖼️ Design Notes
Use modern, clean UI (light theme)

Font: system default or Inter

Style priorities: clarity > flash

Prefer tabs, cards, and color-coded status chips (e.g., green = done, red = missing)
