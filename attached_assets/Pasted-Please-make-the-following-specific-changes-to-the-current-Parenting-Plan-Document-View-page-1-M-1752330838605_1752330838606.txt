Please make the following specific changes to the current Parenting Plan Document View page:

1. **Main View Default**
   - The default view should be the **full scrollable document**, not collapsed section cards.
   - Remove the separate "Sections" view.
   - Instead, display all sections in order on the main page, styled like a legal document.
   - Each section should have:
     - A clear section heading.
     - The full body text.
     - Subtle dividers between sections.

2. **Left Sidebar Navigation**
   - Change the left sidebar to a **Table of Contents list**.
   - Each item in the list should:
     - Be a link that smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section anchor in the main document.
     - Highlight the active section when in view.

3. **Remove Document Overview and Comments Tabs**
   - Completely remove the “Document Overview” tab in the left sidebar.
   - Remove the “Comments” tab in the left sidebar.
   - We will only show comments as inline discussions on proposed changes later—no general comments section.

4. **Right Sidebar (AI Assistant)**
   - Rename "Helpful Actions" to **AI Parenting Plan Assistant**.
   - Change the style to look more like a chat or Intercom widget:
     - Show a short prompt: “How can I help you with this section?”
     - Keep the existing quick action buttons.
     - Below the buttons, add a text input box so users can type a question.
     - Style the input like a message field (rounded, subtle placeholder text).
   - Use a lighter background or subtle border to make this panel visually distinct.

5. **Action Bar**
   - Keep the top action buttons as is, but ensure labels are clear:
     - Propose Changes (primary button)
     - Download
     - Print
     - More Actions dropdown
   - Remove any duplicate or unnecessary icons.

6. **Visual Styling Updates**
   - Use a warm color palette (light purples and neutrals) rather than stark white.
   - Add a subtle subheader under the main title: “This agreement helps you create a stable, cooperative plan for your children.”
   - Use modern typography with clear hierarchy.
   - Keep all corners slightly rounded for a softer feel.

7. **Interactivity**
   - Make sure clicking a section in the Table of Contents smoothly scrolls to the correct place in the document.
   - Highlight the section in view in the sidebar.

8. **Responsiveness**
   - On smaller screens:
     - Collapse the sidebar into a hamburger menu.
     - Allow the AI Assistant panel to slide over the content when opened.

Do not remove any other existing functionality. These updates should build on the current design rather than replacing it completely.
