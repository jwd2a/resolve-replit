Please build a single-page Parenting Plan Document View for our family co-parenting platform, Resolve. This page should be clean, modern, emotionally supportive, and fully responsive.

**Purpose:**
Allow parents to comfortably read, navigate, and understand their Parenting Partnership Agreement, with supportive AI assistance and clear action options.

**Layout & Structure:**

1. **Sticky Top Header**
   - Large title: "Parenting Partnership Agreement"
   - Subheader below the title: "This agreement helps you create a stable, cooperative plan for your children."
   - Status badge on the right (e.g., "Draft") with a distinct color
   - Last updated date beside or below the status badge
   - Action buttons:
     - Propose Changes (primary button)
     - Download
     - Print
     - More Actions dropdown (for Share Link, View History)
   - Clear spacing and modern typography

2. **Left Sidebar – Table of Contents**
   - Vertical list of document sections:
     - Parenting Time Schedule
     - Holiday and Vacation Schedule
     - Decision Making Authority
     - Communication Guidelines
   - Clicking a section smoothly scrolls the main content area to that section
   - The active section highlights in the sidebar as the user scrolls
   - This sidebar replaces any separate “Sections,” “Overview,” or “Comments” tabs—**just one navigation list**

3. **Main Document Area**
   - Display the full parenting plan document in a single scrollable view
   - Each section includes:
     - A clear section heading
     - Full body text styled for readability (like a legal document)
     - Subtle dividers or light shading between sections
   - Use warm, neutral background colors and rounded corners for a friendly feel
   - Optional: Provide a toggle to expand/collapse all sections at once

4. **Right Sidebar – AI Parenting Plan Assistant**
   - Title: "AI Parenting Plan Assistant"
   - Display an introductory prompt: "How can I help you with this section?"
   - Include quick action buttons:
     - Summarize Section
     - Explain Legal Terms
     - Compare to Template
     - Request Professional Review
   - Below the buttons, include a text input field styled like a chat message input with placeholder text (“Type your question…”)
   - Design this panel to look like a modern support widget (inspired by Intercom), with a visually distinct background or subtle border

5. **Visual Design & Emotional Tone**
   - Use warm, supportive colors: light purples, soft grays, and neutral backgrounds
   - Modern typography with clear hierarchy
   - Slightly rounded corners on cards, buttons, and input fields
   - Hover and focus styles for all buttons and navigation links
   - Overall tone should feel calm, professional, and reassuring

6. **Interactivity & Behavior**
   - Smooth scrolling when clicking items in the Table of Contents
   - Highlight the active section in the sidebar
   - The AI Assistant quick action buttons should show placeholder interactions or popups
   - Propose Changes button should be prominent and styled as the primary action

7. **Responsiveness**
   - On tablet and mobile:
     - Left sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu
     - Right AI Assistant collapses into a floating button that opens the assistant as a slide-out panel
     - Top action buttons stack or collapse into a dropdown menu

8. **Accessibility**
   - Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels for main landmarks, navigation, and buttons
   - Ensure text and button colors have sufficient contrast

9. **Demo Data**
   - Populate example content for each document section
   - Use placeholder participant names and dates

**Important Notes:**
- This is a single cohesive page. Do not build separate views or tabs.
- There should be no separate “Sections” view—**the full document is always visible**.
- No general “Comments” tab—comments will be part of proposed changes later.

Please create modular, clean code that is easy to maintain and extend.
