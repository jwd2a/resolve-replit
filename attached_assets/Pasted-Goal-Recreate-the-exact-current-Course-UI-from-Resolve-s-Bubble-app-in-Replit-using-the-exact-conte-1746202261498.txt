Goal:
Recreate the exact current Course UI from Resolve’s Bubble app in Replit using the exact content, structure, and styling from the screenshot. This is not a wireframe — this is a visual replica of the real product view so it can be the foundation for future design iterations.

🧱 Overall Layout
Create a 3-column responsive layout, full width (desktop view). Use flex or grid to structure columns as:

Left Nav: 20–25% width

Main Content Area: 50–60% width

Right Panel: 25–30% width

🔹 LEFT COLUMN: Course Module Navigation
Use vertical accordion-style layout:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Module 1  
Welcome to Resolve       [+]

Module 2  
Parental Responsibility
and Decision Making      [+]

Module 3  
Timesharing Schedule     [SELECTED]

Module 4  
Educational Decisions     [+]

Module 5  
Introduction to Final
Considerations           [+]
Module 3 is currently active, highlight with a blue vertical bar on the left and border or background

Use proper indentation for submodules (if needed)

Use light backgrounds and hover state styling

🔹 MIDDLE COLUMN: Course Content
1. Section Title (H1):
nginx
Copy
Edit
Travel & Work Restrictions
2. Embedded Video Player:
Use exact thumbnail and text from screenshot

Title overlay:

3. Tip Box (“Things to keep in mind”):

Bullet points:

Set clear notice requirements for travel plans.

Share itineraries and emergency contacts.
