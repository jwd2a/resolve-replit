# Resolve App – Other Stuff Section
**Path**: `/childsupport`  
**Title**: *Child Support Range Estimator*

---

## Overview

This section provides a prototype prompt for building a **Child Support Range Estimator Tool** within Resolve. It's designed to be a starting point for product and engineering teams to implement a simple, educational tool that helps co-parents get a *realistic monthly range* of expected child support without involving litigation.

## Prompt for Replit Canvas or Product Implementation

### Goal
Create a simple, user-friendly web app where co-parents can enter financial and custody-related data and receive an estimated *range* of monthly child support obligations based on standard state guidelines.

## Pages / Views

### 1. Welcome / Intro Page
**Purpose**: Briefly explain what the tool does and reassure users of privacy.  
**Components**:
- Headline: “Estimate Your Child Support Range”
- Text: “Answer a few quick questions and see your estimated monthly range in minutes. This is not legal advice but a helpful starting point.”
- Start button

---

### 2. Data Collection Page (Multi-Step Form)
**Purpose**: Collect key inputs to calculate the support estimate.  
**Step-by-step fields**:
- Parent A Monthly Income
- Parent B Monthly Income
- Number of Children
- Who has primary custody? (Shared / Parent A / Parent B)
- # of Overnights with each parent
- Monthly child-related expenses (optional)
- State (Dropdown—used to tailor future versions)

---

### 3. Results Page
**Purpose**: Display the estimated support range clearly.  
**Components**:
- Estimated Support Range: e.g., `$1,800 – $2,400 per month`
- Median Value: e.g., `$2,100`
- Factors that influenced the range (bullets: income gap, custody time)
- Adjust Inputs button
- Optional Download Summary (PDF or shareable summary)

---

### 4. Disclaimer / About Page
- Notes this is an *educational tool only*.  
- Encourages users to consult legal or mediation professionals if needed.

## Estimation Logic (Initial Placeholder)

Use this simplified logic for now until state-specific calculations are implemented:

```python
base_amount = (Parent A Income + Parent B Income) * 0.20
```

Adjust based on custody split (overnights) and other modifiers.  
Return a range of ±10–15% to reflect common outcomes and negotiation variability.

## Technology Considerations
- Can be built using HTML/CSS/JS in Replit Canvas
- Optional: Save input data using LocalStorage
- Stretch Goals:
  - PDF Export
  - Connect to API for state-specific guidelines
