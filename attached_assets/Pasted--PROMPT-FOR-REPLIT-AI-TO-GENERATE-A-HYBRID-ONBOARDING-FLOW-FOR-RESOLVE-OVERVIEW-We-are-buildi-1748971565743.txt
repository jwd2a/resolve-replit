// PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI TO GENERATE A HYBRID ONBOARDING FLOW FOR RESOLVE

/*
OVERVIEW:
We are building an onboarding flow for Resolve, a platform that helps separating or divorcing parents collaboratively build a co-parenting plan.

The onboarding needs to:
1. Begin with an emotionally supportive, quiz-like experience inspired by Peech (https://go.getpeech.com) — light, conversational, and human.
2. Then transition into structured form inputs that collect all required data for the parenting plan builder.

The end result is a seamless, two-part experience:
- Part 1: Emotionally aware onboarding (4–5 light steps)
- Part 2: Legal & structured data collection (5 detailed steps)
*/

// 🟣 USE:
// - React with functional components and hooks
// - TailwindCSS for layout and styling
// - Modular design (two main components: PartOneIntroFlow and PartTwoProfileForm)
// - Emoji and icon-friendly input options for Part 1

// PART 1 — EMOTIONALLY AWARE INTRO FLOW
// Softly introduces the platform and collects context
// Use card-based inputs, multiple choice, and emoji-rich responses

// Questions:
// 1. How are you feeling about creating a co-parenting plan today?
//    😟 Nervous and unsure | 😐 Just getting started | 🙂 Hopeful | 😭 Overwhelmed
//
// 2. What best describes your current situation with your co-parent?
//    Still living together | Recently separated | Living apart | Never lived together
//
// 3. What’s most important to you right now?
//    🎯 Avoiding court | 👧 Protecting the kids | 🕊️ Finishing quickly | 📅 Staying organized
//
// 4. Would you like to invite your co-parent now or later?
//    📨 Invite now | 🕓 I’ll do it later
//
// At the end: transition into structured onboarding with a supportive message.


// PART 2 — STRUCTURED PROFILE FORM
// Collect all required data, step-by-step, in softened UX language:

// STEP 1: Your Info
// - Legal Name
// - Legal Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)
// - Phone Number

// STEP 2: Co-Parent Info
// - Co-Parent Legal Name
// - Co-Parent Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)
// - Co-Parent Phone Number
// - Co-Parent Email Address

// STEP 3: Children Info
// - Child Full Name
// - Child Date of Birth
// - Child Gender
// (Allow adding multiple children)

// STEP 4: Jurisdiction
// - What U.S. state will you be filing for divorce or separation?

// STEP 5: Confirmation screen or onboarding complete message.


// FINAL NOTES:
// - The whole experience should feel like a guided conversation
// - Please use a soft visual style with welcoming tones and emoji where appropriate
// - Onboarding container should manage transitions between steps (step state, data collection)

// Please generate the full flow as modular components suitable for integration into an existing React + Tailwind project.
// Begin with the main onboarding container, then create each part as separate components.
