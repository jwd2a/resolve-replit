I am redesigning the "Parenting Plan" document screen for our co-parenting platform Resolve. The goal is to create a modern, emotionally supportive, and intuitive user experience for viewing, editing, and managing the parenting plan.

Here is the redesign specification. Build a responsive, clean React (or HTML/CSS/JavaScript) prototype implementing the following:

1. **Overall Layout**
   - Use a sticky top header with:
     - Large title: "Parenting Partnership Agreement"
     - Status badge to the right (e.g., "Draft", "Final", "Signed")
     - "Last Updated" date below or beside the status
     - Primary action button: "Propose Changes"
     - Secondary actions: "Download", "Print"
     - Overflow menu (â‹®) with "View History", "Share Link"
   - Left-side vertical navigation (or tabs across the top) with:
     - Overview
     - Sections
     - Comments
     - History
   - Main document area with:
     - Clear headings for each section (Section 1, Section 2, etc.)
     - Collapsible/expandable sections
     - Tables styled as cards with subtle shading and spacing
     - Section anchors for easy navigation
   - Right-side panel with contextual assistance:
     - In View Mode:
       - A summary box:
         - Status, last updated, participants
       - Helpful actions:
         - Summarize Section
         - Explain Legal Terms
         - Compare to Template
         - Request Professional Review
     - In Edit Mode:
       - AI Suggestions
       - Compliance Validation
       - Tracked Changes Toggle

2. **Visual Styling**
   - Softer, friendly colors (light purples, blues, neutrals)
   - Rounded corners on containers
   - Modern typography with clear hierarchy
   - Hover and focus styles for buttons and navigation
   - Emotional tone that is warm, calm, and supportive

3. **Action Buttons**
   - "Propose Changes": primary color, prominent
   - "Download", "Print": secondary styles
   - "More Actions": icon button
   - Consistent icon set (e.g., Lucide icons)

4. **Propose Changes Flow**
   - When the user clicks "Propose Changes":
     - Enable inline editing
     - Highlight editable fields
     - Show a side-by-side or tracked changes view
     - "Submit Proposed Changes" button with optional comments
   - Allow canceling the edit mode

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the design adapts to tablet and mobile:
     - Collapsible side navigation
     - Floating action button for "Propose Changes"

6. **Accessibility**
   - Use semantic HTML
   - ARIA labels where necessary
   - Sufficient color contrast

7. **Demo Data**
   - Populate the document with example sections and a table of parent details.

Please create a clean, modular structure with clear component boundaries so it can be easily adapted later. Provide example styles and layout, and include placeholder content where appropriate.
