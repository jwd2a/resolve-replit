 Prompt: Build a Unified Onboarding Flow for a Parenting App
Goal:
Create a seamless, emotionally supportive onboarding journey for a co-parenting course app. This replaces our current “setup wizard → home screen → second wizard” experience with one clear, guided flow.

🎯 UX Philosophy:
This is not just form-filling — it’s the beginning of the parenting journey.

The tone should be warm, human, and supportive — not administrative.

Each step should feel purposeful, visually cohesive, and low-stress.

Avoid abrupt context switches (no sudden jump to a dashboard).

📚 Flow Structure (6 Steps):
Parent Info

Full Name, Address, Phone, Email for Parent & Co-Parent

Invite co-parent if not already joined (soft, optional)

Children Info

Add name, birthdate, and gender for each child

Jurisdiction

Select the state where the parenting plan will be filed

Required Forms

Show required forms (e.g., waiver, consent)

Let users sign digitally or skip for now (with a soft warning)

Co-Parent Status

Show if co-parent has registered

If not: prompt to invite, or continue solo

Parenting Preferences (Optional)

Allow selection of relevant holidays and family traditions

Users can skip or complete this step later

✅ Final Screen:

“You’re all set! You can now begin your Parenting Plan course.”

Button: Start Course Now

🎨 Design Details:
Use a step progress indicator at the top (e.g., Step 4 of 6)

Each screen should include:

A warm, friendly title (e.g., “Tell us about your children”)

Brief helper text

Cleanly grouped input fields with subtle helper copy

Primary CTA: Continue

Optional: “Save and Finish Later” under the button

Use subtle icons and soft color backgrounds to guide the user visually

Include success indicators (like checkmarks, progress bars) to build momentum

🧩 Behavior Rules:
Do not show the dashboard until onboarding is 100% complete or explicitly skipped

Save partial progress (e.g., localStorage, session, or backend session)

If the user exits mid-flow, resume from the last completed step when they return

If a co-parent joins later, they go through the same flow (skip what’s already complete
