// UPDATED PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI

/*
GOAL:
We are updating our Resolve onboarding flow to improve emotional UX, streamline legal data collection, and clean up some visual inconsistencies.

The existing flow has two phases:
1. Emotional Check-In (4 steps)
2. Legal Profile Collection (5 steps)

This prompt should generate an updated onboarding experience using React and TailwindCSS that addresses the following changes:
*/

// 🔁 STRUCTURAL CHANGES
// 1. Emotional check-in steps (first 4) should NOT show a progress bar
// 2. Progress bar begins at "Step 1 of 5" on the Legal Profile steps only


// 🎯 FUNCTIONAL & UX CHANGES
// Emotional Check-In:
// Step 1: "How are you feeling about creating a co-parenting plan today?"
// - Change to MULTI-SELECT
// - Options: Nervous and unsure 😟, Just getting started 😐, Hopeful 🙂, Overwhelmed 😭
//
// Step 3: "What’s most important to you right now?"
// - Change to MULTI-SELECT
// - Change "Finishing quickly" ➜ "Saving money 💰"
// - Other options remain: Avoiding court 🎯, Protecting the kids 👶, Staying organized 🗓️


// Legal Profile Collection:
// Step 1: Your Info
// - Legal Name
// - Legal Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)
// - Phone Number
// - ADD: Your Email Address (required)
//
// Step 2: Co-Parent Info
// - Co-Parent Legal Name
// - Co-Parent Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)
// - Co-Parent Phone Number
// - Co-Parent Email Address (required, regardless of whether they’re invited now or later)
//
// Step 3: Children Info
// - SHOW one child input section by default (Name, DOB, Gender)
// - Button to "Add Another Child"
//
// Step 4: Jurisdiction (no change)
// Step 5: All Set! confirmation (no change)


// 🎨 VISUAL + DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS
// - Make emoji and text options center-aligned in both axes
// - Use full-width selectable buttons or cards with Tailwind hover + active states
// - Allow clear visual distinction for multi-select chips
// - Maintain icon headers for each question (💜 heart, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 people, 🎯 target, ✉️ envelope, etc.)


// 📦 TECH SPEC
// - React with functional components and hooks
// - TailwindCSS for styling
// - Modular design: Each step should be its own component
// - Parent component manages navigation state and form data


// ✅ DELIVERABLE:
// A fully updated version of the Resolve onboarding flow that reflects the above changes and is structured to cleanly integrate into our existing app.
