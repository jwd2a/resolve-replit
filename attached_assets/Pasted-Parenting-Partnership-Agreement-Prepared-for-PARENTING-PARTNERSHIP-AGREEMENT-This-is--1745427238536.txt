This document is intended to be the basis of a child custody determination for the purposes of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.

SECTION 4 - PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY & DECISION MAKING
A. Shared Decision-Making for Major Decisions.
We are going to make decisions about our children as co- parents, together, and always with our child(ren)’s best interests as the most important guiding concern. These decisions include all important decisions affecting the welfare of our child(ren), such as decisions about the child(ren)’s education, healthcare, mental health and life-enriching activities. Neither of us will have a superior right or authority when it comes to co-parenting our children. We will treat each other as equals and we will make sure our child(ren) see us as equals to the best of our ability. We will never involve our children in any disputes that we may have about them because we understand how damaging this could be for our children.
B. How We Will Resolve Disagreements.
If we are ever unable to resolve a disagreement then we will immediately seek professional advice from the most qualified person that is reasonably available to us. This could be a doctor, educator, mental health professional, or someone else that can assist us in properly and diligently considering all of the information that is relevant to any decision. We will try to always keep open minds and respect each other, even when we disagree.

 C. Day-to-Day Decision-Making.
Nothing here is intended to interfere with our respective rights to make decisions regarding the day-to-day care and control of our child(ren) while the child(ren) are with us. Similarly, we both are allowed to make emergency decisions affecting the health or safety of the child(ren) if such a decision is ever necessary. If there is ever such an emergency, then we both commit to notify each other of the situation as soon as reasonably possible.
D. Extra-curricular Activities.
We agree that extracurricular activities are very important for the development of our child(ren) in many respects. We will discuss all proposed extracurricular activities with each other, and these are the things we agree are important to consider:
The child’s preference Geography
Practicality of the schedule Cost
Required Equipment Academic performance Travel schedule
Other

 E. Sharing Information/Important Records.
We both will have equal access to all important information about our child(ren). We will each take care to ensure that anytime we have the opportunity to list the other parent’s name on any form, we will do so because it is our intention to both be listed as authorized parties/contacts/recipients for all medical, school and other records pertaining to our child(ren). We also will try our best to always share any information that we obtain anytime we independently consult with any and all professionals involved with the child(ren). If we are able to do so, we also will seek and provide to each other copies of important records we receive. Both parents have equal rights to inspect and receive governmental agency and law enforcement records concerning the child(ren). Both of us will have equal and independent authority to confer with the child(ren)’s school, day care, health care providers, and other programs with regard to the child(ren)’s educational, emotional, and social progress.
Both of us will always be listed as “emergency contacts” for the child(ren).
F. Communication.
We agree and understand that communication is critical to good co-parenting. We also agree and understand that communications regarding our child(ren) should be between the two of us and should be between us, as parents. Neither of us will ever use a child as a messenger to convey information, ask questions, or set up schedule changes. We agree to communicate freely with each other in a respectful manner using the methods of communication we historically have used, which include email, phone, and/or text message. If we ever have an issue communicating or keeping track of our communications we will employ a communication tool intended to keep a record of our communications so we can refer back to them.
We also agree that we will immediately use a calendaring tool so that we can have equal and open access to a calendar that shows all of our child(ren)’s important dates, events and activities.
We further agree and understand that our child(ren) deserve(s) to have communication with both of us whenever reasonable, which is not more than once or twice on most days. We each will ensure that our child(ren) has/have regular contact with the other parent in a manner that does not interfere with time sharing and routines. We agree that contact is important, but so is a certain amount of independence, so contact should not be repetitive, unnecessarily lengthy or overly emotional. We also agree that a
    Mother’s Initials

 five-minute or less phone call with a child typically is sufficient absent some unusual circumstance that would require a longer call.
If we are providing our child(ren) with a communication device, it will be provided and paid for as follows:
Paid by Father Paid by Mother Split Equally Other

  G. Child Care.
We agree that the selection of individuals to care for our child(ren) is very important and that we each should be given consideration in this selection. We will try our best to use the same child care providers so that our child(ren) has/have consistency and safety. We also agree that if either of us is ever going to be unavailable overnight to care for our child(ren), we will give the other parent the opportunity to care for the child(ren) during that time. We also agree that we will give respect to each other’s wishes and concerns regarding the child(ren) spending overnights at other people’s/children’s homes, but that neither of us has the right to dictate how the child’s social life will be while the child(ren) is/are at the other parent’s home. We also both agree that the child(ren)’s relationships with extended family members is important and that having the child(ren) spend time overnight with extended family members is not a violation of anyone’s rights.

 SECTION 5 - TIME SHARING SCHEDULE
A. Scheduling and Our Calendar
We will exchange any school and extracurricular activity calendars as soon as we are able to after receiving them. We both acknowledge how important it is for us both to understand our child(ren)’s schedules. We are going to follow the dates set forth on our child(ren)’s school calendars when it comes to understanding academic breaks from school. We agree that academic breaks shall begin at the end of the last scheduled day of classes before the break and shall end when our child(ren) is/are returned to school on the first day of regularly scheduled classes after the holiday or break.
We agree that some flexibility will be required of both of us and that it is very important that we show each other respect both in asking for flexibility and in granting flexibility. We also understand that maintaining a routine is the best possible thing for our child(ren), so we will each do our best to avoid asking for schedule changes on a regular basis just to accommodate our own personal needs. In other words, we each acknowledge that flexibility should only be required on occasion when circumstances arise that are simply beyond our control, and not as a matter of personal or selfish convenience. If either of us asks for a change to the schedule, we commit to do that as soon as possible after the need to make the request arises. We also both agree that if the schedule change causes the other person to incur a child care expense, that expense will be paid by the person asking for the change, which is simply a matter of fairness.

If our holiday schedule would result in one of us having the child(ren) for three weekends in a row, then we will exchange the third weekend, so that we each end up having two weekends in a row, after which we will resume the regular alternating weekend pattern that was ongoing before the holiday. Also, if either of us has the child(ren) on a weekend immediately before or after an unspecified holiday or non-school day (e.g. a teacher’s work day or a Monday holiday like President’s Day), then that holiday or non-school day shall just attach to that weekend.

If either of us is going to be more than 15 minutes late, we will text or call the other parent to let them know. If this causes a need for flexibility on occasion, then flexibility will be given. If this becomes a recurring problem, then we will seek professional advice on how to stop it. Exchanges will be at school, camp, activities or the parents’ homes, as we will agree from time to time depending on our child(ren)’s needs and schedules.
