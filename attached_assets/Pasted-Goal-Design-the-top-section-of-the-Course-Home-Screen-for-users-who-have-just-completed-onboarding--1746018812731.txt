Goal:
Design the top section of the Course Home Screen for users who have just completed onboarding but cannot begin the course until their co-parent has joined.
This section should clearly and calmly:

Welcome the user and reflect their family setup

Explain why they can’t start the course yet

Prompt them to invite or remind their co-parent

Reserve space for a Start Course button that becomes active only after both parents are registered

🧱 Layout Requirements
🧩 Container Style:
Card-style container centered on the page

Soft neutral or lavender background (#F8F6FF or #FAFAFC)

Rounded corners, light shadow, well-padded layout

Not full-width — balanced on large screens, stackable on mobile

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Family Summary Display:
Show avatars or initials for each co-parent

If co-parent is invited but not joined, show as “Pending”

Show children's names underneath

Example layout:

Copy
Edit
🟢 Eric      🟡 Sarah (Pending)
👧 Children: Mila
🗣️ Text Content (Professional, Clear)
Headline:

You’re almost ready to begin.

Subheading options (pick one):

“Both co-parents must join before the course can begin.”

“Once your co-parent registers, you’ll be able to start the course together.”

If no co-parent has been invited yet:

Show this message instead:

“Invite your co-parent to join so you can begin the course together.”

🔘 Button(s) — Conditional
If co-parent is not invited:
Show button:

Invite Co-Parent to Join

If co-parent is invited but not yet joined:
Show button:

Send Reminder

If both are registered:
Replace above with:

Start Course (active)

📉 Optional Placeholder for Progress:
Do not show progress or course status yet

Once both parents have joined and course begins, replace this entire section with the "in-progress" version (can be handled in logic)

🧭 Behavior Rules
The Start Course button should only appear if both co-parents are fully registered

Until then, the screen should reinforce that joint participation is required

Co-parent status should update in real-time if possible (e.g., once Sarah signs up, it reflects immediately)

🖋️ Tone Guidelines
Calm, confident, and respectful

Speak directly and clearly, without emotional overtones or soft metaphors

Prioritize clarity over fluff, especially around what the user can and cannot do yet

✅ Summary for Replit:
Branded top section that welcomes users and sets context

Reflects family setup (parents + children)

Communicates why course access is blocked

Provides appropriate CTA based on co-parent status

Tone: modern, supportive, professional
