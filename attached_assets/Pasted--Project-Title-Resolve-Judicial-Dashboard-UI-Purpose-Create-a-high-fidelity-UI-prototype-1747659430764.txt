**Project Title:**
Resolve – Judicial Dashboard UI

**Purpose:**
Create a high-fidelity UI prototype for the Judicial Dashboard that matches the overall look and feel of the Resolve platform. The focus is on clean, professional, human-centered design with no backend or functionality—purely for visual walkthroughs and stakeholder alignment.

**Design Direction:**
- Match Resolve’s modern, calm, and trustworthy aesthetic.
- Prioritize clarity, ease of use, and minimal cognitive load.
- Use consistent fonts, button styles, iconography, and spacing as seen in other Resolve screens.
- All elements are static—no interactivity or data fetching required.

**Layout Structure:**

**1. Header (Top Bar)**
- Platform name: “Resolve Judicial”
- Case search bar (placeholder only)
- Judge’s profile icon (top right)

**2. Left Navigation (Sidebar)**
- Case Overview
- Parenting Plan
- Compliance Tracker
- Financial Summary
- Documents
- Notes & Flags
- Timeline

Styled to mirror Resolve’s left-side menu on logged-in screens, with subtle hover effects and clear active state.
