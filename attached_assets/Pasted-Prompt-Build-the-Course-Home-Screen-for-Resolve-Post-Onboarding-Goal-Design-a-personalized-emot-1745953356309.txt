Prompt: Build the Course Home Screen for Resolve (Post-Onboarding)
Goal:
Design a personalized, emotionally supportive Course Home Screen for users who have completed onboarding. This is their new “basecamp” to:

Track course progress

Complete remaining admin tasks (like forms or waivers)

View/edit family info

Resume the course

The experience should be branded, calm, and focused, with a clear CTA to continue their co-parenting journey.

🎨 Screen Structure & Layout
1. Welcome & Status Header
Show user’s first name:

“Welcome back, Eric.”

Short progress message:

“You're 45% of the way through your course.”

Primary CTA:

[Continue Course ➡️]

2. Course Outline Section
Show a vertical list of course modules with status indicators:

Module 1: Foundations ✅

Module 2: Communication ✅

Module 3: Custody ⚡ (in progress)

Module 4: Holidays ⏳ (not started)

Secondary button:

[View Full Outline]

3. Forms & Admin Tasks Section
If any required forms/tasks were skipped during onboarding, show here:

❗ Waiver not signed

❗ Holiday preferences not completed

Include helpful icons and supportive tone

CTA:

[Complete These Items]

4. Family Information & Edit Access
Compact card or section:

Parents:

Eric ✅

Co-Parent: Pending ❗ (“Invite sent” or “Not yet registered”)

Children:

Mila ✅

Button:

[Edit Family Info]

5. Optional Footer or Banner
Soft message like:

“Need help? Our support team is just a click away.”
→ [Contact Support]

🧭 UX Behavior & Rules
Continue Course should take users to the last module they worked on

Users should see only the sections relevant to them (don’t show parenting plan status here)

If all admin tasks are complete, hide that section and replace with:

“✅ All required items completed!”

✍️ Tone & Microcopy Guidelines
Friendly, human-centered tone: “You're making great progress!”

Avoid pressure — everything should feel optional, even if required

Labels:

Continue Course, Edit Info, Complete Items, Invite Co-Parent

📐 Design Details
Clean two-column or vertical layout

Branded with Resolve logo and soft color scheme

Subtle progress bar or visual badge indicators

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Top nav with logo, optional avatar, and Support link
