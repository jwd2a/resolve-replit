Redesign the Pre-Course Checklist Panel for Resolve
Goal:
Update the Pre-Course Checklist section to reduce vertical height, streamline layout, and include a new item for Family Information.
This section helps users track their readiness to start the course by showing completed steps and guiding them to finish the rest.

🧱 Layout & Component Updates
1. Section Title
Change the title from:
“Before You Start the Course”
to:
“Pre-Course Checklist”

Remove the current subheading below it (the one that repeats "Pre-Course Checklist")

2. Add New Checklist Item: Family Information
Position: First in the list (above Co-Parent Registration)

Label: Family Information

Description: “Review the family details you provided during onboarding.”

Status Tags (Right-Aligned, Smaller Font):

makefile
Copy
Edit
You: Completed  
Co-Parent: Completed  
Children: Completed  
Jurisdiction: Completed
💡 Design Note:
For now, assume all four statuses show as "Completed", but this should support Pending for any of them in the future.

CTA (Right-Aligned):
[ Review & Edit ]

3. Adjust All Checklist Items
For every checklist item (Family Info, Co-Parent, Waivers, Holidays, Course Session):

Reduce vertical padding and spacing (match the compact styling shown in the second screenshot)

Move the status tags (e.g., "You: Pending", "Co-Parent: Pending") to the bottom right, directly beneath the CTA

Maintain left-aligned icons and right-aligned actions

Use a uniform card height for all items

🗂️ Final Checklist Item Order
Family Information

Co-Parent Registration

Waivers & Agreements

Holiday Preferences

Schedule Course Session (Optional)

📐 Design Style Notes
Use subtle shadows or light borders to keep card separation clean

Icons should remain on the left (match current Resolve icon style)

Status tags should:

Use green for "Completed"

Use orange for "Pending"

Be styled in smaller text, stacked or inline depending on length

✅ Interaction Behavior
Family Info: Always clickable via [ Review & Edit ]

Other items: Keep existing action links (e.g., [Invite Co-Parent], [Review & Sign])

All statuses should update dynamically based on user progress
