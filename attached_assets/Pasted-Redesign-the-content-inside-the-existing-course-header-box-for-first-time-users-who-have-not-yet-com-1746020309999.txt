Redesign the content inside the existing course header box for first-time users who have not yet completed the required items.

Keep the existing size, padding, and gradient styling exactly as is

Replace the current text with a first-time onboarding summary

The main goal is to gently push the user to complete the three required items:

✅ Sign waivers

✅ Select holiday preferences

✅ Ensure co-parent is registered

Only once all three are done will the Start Course button become active.

🎯 Content & Layout (Inside Gradient Box)
Title:

Welcome to Your Family’s Parenting Plan

Subheading (new):

Let’s get a few things in place so you’re ready to begin.

📝 Task Checklist (inside the box)
Use a 3-item checklist with icons or status indicators like this:

swift
Copy
Edit
☐ Sign required waivers  
☐ Choose your family’s holiday preferences  
☐ Co-parent registration required
Use visual indicators (checkmarks, circles, or muted icons) that can dynamically update as items are completed.

If an item is complete, switch to ✅ or “Completed” tag

🔘 Button Logic:
Button Label:

Start Course

State:

❌ Disabled until all three checklist items are complete

Tooltip or microtext under the button:

All items must be completed before starting.

✍️ Optional Microcopy Enhancements:
If you want a little polish without sounding cheesy:

Instead of “Let’s get a few things in place...” try:

“To begin your course, please complete the following steps.”

Below the checklist, add:

Your progress will be saved as you go.

🧭 Behavior & Rules:
The card remains visible and static (no vertical expansion needed)

Once all three prerequisites are done, button state changes from disabled → active

After the course starts, this entire box can switch to the in-progress view

✅ Final Summary
Keep: card size, gradient background, rounded corners

Replace: current text + progress bar with a 3-item checklist, clean headline, and clear inactive CTA

Goal: guide user to complete setup and be emotionally ready to begin
