Goal:
Build a visual, fridge-friendly custody calendar view that uses plan data to display which parent the child is with on each day.
This calendar should be styled for easy reading by parents and kids, and should be printable or shareable.

🧱 Layout Structure
Top: Month/Year heading (e.g., “May 2025”)

Calendar grid: 7-column week view

Columns: Sun → Sat (or Mon → Sun if preferred)

Each cell = one calendar day

Below grid: a legend explaining icons/colors

📆 Calendar Cell Design (Each Day)
Each day block includes:

Date + Day (e.g., “Mon 13”)

Color-coded box:

Pink = Mom’s House

Blue = Dad’s House

Icon:

Home icon = where the child stays that night

→ Arrow = exchange day

🏫 = school pickup/dropoff (optional)

Text Label: “Mom” or “Dad”

Optional: white background or slight gradient for visual lift

🔄 Navigation
Previous / Next buttons (top right) to cycle months

These buttons should re-render the full grid with data from the appropriate month

🎨 Legend (Bottom of Page)
Show a fixed legend block like this:

rust
Copy
Edit
🟥 Mom's House    🟦 Dad's House    ➡ Exchange Day    🏫 School Pickup/Dropoff
Use rounded tags or chips with background color

Match the exact iconography from calendar days

🧪 Functionality in Replit
Use mock plan data:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "2025-05-01": { "parent": "Mom", "exchange": false, "school": false },
  "2025-05-02": { "parent": "Dad", "exchange": true, "school": true },
  ...
}
Generate the calendar grid based on the month

Style each day block dynamically using this data

No backend logic needed — this is a front-end display

🖼️ Design Goals
Font: clean, readable (think kid-safe)

Visual hierarchy: parent name big, icons clear, dates small

Light card styling (padding, rounded corners)

Even spacing so that printing doesn’t break formatting

🔁 Optional Enhancements (can come later)
Toggle between “Month View” and “List View”

Export as PDF or print-friendly version

Mobile responsiveness
