Here's our restoration plan:

1. We need to put back the original home6.tsx file
2. The older backup is incomplete (missing the rest of the file)
3. We need to fix the syntax errors

Let's create a minimal fix:

1. We'll keep the original requirements array without the schedule item (this was a valid change)
2. We won't add any background styling to the checklist section
3. We'll make sure all the tags are properly closed
